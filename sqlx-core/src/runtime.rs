/// Describes a set of types and functions used to open and manage IO resources within SQLx.
///
/// In the greater ecosystem we have several choices for an asynchronous runtime (executor) to
/// schedule and interact with our futures. Libraries that wish to be generally available have
/// tended to either pick one (and allow compatibility wrappers to others) or use mutually-exclusive
/// cargo feature flags to pick between runtimes. Each of these approaches have their own
/// problems.
///
/// In SQLx, most types and traits are parameterized with a `Rt: Runtime` bound. Asynchronous
/// implementations of `Runtime` are available for [**async-std**](https://async.rs/),
/// [**Tokio**](https://tokio.rs/), and [**Actix**](https://actix.rs/) (given
/// those crate features are activated).
///
/// -   [`AsyncStd`]
/// -   [`Tokio`]
/// -   [`Actix`]
///
/// Additionally, a `std` blocking runtime is provided. This is intended for use in
/// environments where asynchronous IO either doesn't make sense or isn't available.
///
/// -   [`Blocking`][crate::Blocking]
